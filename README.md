## UX/UI Section

### Site goal

The main goal of Fitness Factory website is to convice users that they can change their body with proper training and nutrition in as little as six
months, providing information on training programme and nutrition required to do so. It's very important that the information and navigation is well 
organized so that users can get all the information they need to convince them to sign up and join us. Coding part should be done well so that new 
administrators can add or change programmes and nutrition part when new science discoveries are made in fitness industry.

### Design choices
In the landing page we want to inform customers about our gym and all the features it provides. Our navigation bar should give basic idea to the users
what they need to achieve their dream body goal.
