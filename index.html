                <p>
                    Barbells are a valuable tool in the arsenal of a person who wants to gain strength efficiently and
                    safely. Increasing the weight gradually over a period of time will tear down muscle tissue and then
                    rebuild it, ultimately making you stronger. Because you add weight progressively with free weights,
                    you don't have to add repetitions and lengthen your workout. Exercise experts also point to several
                    other benefits of barbells.
