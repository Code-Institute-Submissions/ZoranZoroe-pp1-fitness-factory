                    <p>
                        We all know that you need to eat protein to build muscle. Carbs and fats help
                        provide the energy needed to fuel your physical activities, but these are just
                        the macronutrients. Most people are completely unaware of the powerful effects that
                        certain vitamins and minerals or micronutrients having your capacity to build more
                        muscle recover faster and to see better results.

                <h2>Cholesterol</h2>
                <p>First is a nutrient that will probably surprise you cholesterol now i know doctors trainers and
                    dietitians have been demonizing cholesterol for years now for its supposed negative effect on heart
                    health however research now indicates that there's no link between cholesterol intake and the risk
                    of
                    heart disease even though we have this evidence many people and professionals still cling to the
                    belief
                    that cholesterol and high cholesterol foods like eggs are bad if that happens to be you and you're
                    trying to build muscle you should also know that reducing your cholesterol intake can significantly
                    impair muscle growth for example in a 12-week long strength training study the scientists observed a
                    dose-response relationship between dietary cholesterol and gains in lean muscle mass they also
                    mentioned
                    that this link held up even when the data was controlled for protein intake in other words the more
                    cholesterol the
                    participants ate the more muscle they
                    gained in response to resistance
                    training regardless of how much protein
                    that they took in so don't feel like you
                    have to follow a low cholesterol diet
                    it's not necessary for heart health and
                    it can actually significantly blunt your
                    muscle growth progress</p>

            <div class="nutrition-right">
                <h2>Zinc</h2>
                <p>
                    next is a nutrient that i've talked about quite a bit because it's so important for athletes zinc
                    it's well known that zinc
                    is a crucial mineral for your immune system but very few people realize that it also plays a crucial
                    role in
                    maintaining and gaining muscle mass in fact research shows that a zinc deficiency directly causes
                    lean body mass losses and these muscle losses can
                    be restored with zinc consumption research also shows that even a small zinc deficiency can stunt
                    growth and human development one reason not getting enough zinc can impair muscle growth is that it
                    significantly lowers levels of
                    the primary male sex hormone testosterone which is obviously important for muscle growth
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="nutrition-left"><img src="assets/images/d3.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="nutrition-right">
                <h2>D3</h2>
                <p>
                    another very important vitamin for muscle growth is vitamin d3 this vitamin is produced naturally by
                    the skin after exposure to ultraviolet radiation particularly uvb like what you get from sunlight
                    vitamin d is important for people that want to improve their strength levels because it's required
                    for optimal bone strength immune function mineral metabolism neuromuscular functioning and
                    testosterone synthesis that's why your vitamin d levels influence strength development so much and
                    interestingly enough your vitamin d levels also impact how resistant you are to injuries
                </p>

            <div class="nutrition-left">

            <div class="nutrition-right">
                <h2>Water</h2>
                <p>
                    next is water believe me i know hydration isn't the most exciting topic in the fitness world but it
                    is extremely important for several reasons first of all don't forget that your muscles are
                    about 79 water this is actually one way that dehydration impairs strength even slight dehydration
                    reduces things like the motivation to train body temperature control and of course exercise
                    performance dehydration also blunts muscle growth by lowering muscle protein synthesis while raising
                    protein breakdown just a two percent dehydration rate is enough to impair cognition attention and
                    movement control so being dehydrated will prevent muscle growth on a biological level and will also
                    reduce how well you can perform at the gym that's why it's important to stay hydrated from a muscle
                    building.

            <div class="nutrition-right">
                <h2>Magnesium</h2>
                <p>
                    moving on to magnesium magnesium is crucial for your health and body composition and the average
                    healthy body contains about 22 to 24 grams of this mineral having less of it or being deficient in
                    magnesium can cause insulin resistance low testosterone depression bone loss high blood pressure
                    stress hypersensitivity and disrupted neuromuscular functioning on the other hand research shows
                    that getting enough magnesium boosts testosterone and strength levels while reducing stress one of
                    the reasons magnesium is so crucial for your health and your body composition is that it plays a
                    significant role in the quality of your sleep the issue with magnesium is that many people happen to
                    be deficient research indicates that only 15 to 50
                    percent of americans consume enough magnesium plus we have data that shows that athletes likely need
                    at least 20 is needed for the repair of muscle tissue and because just like zinc magnesium does get
                    lost through your sweat now if you eat a lot of nutrient-dense foods especially lots of fruits
                    vegetables nuts and beans you might get more than enough magnesium but to be on the safe side it's
                    generally a good idea to take a magnesium supplement
                </p>

                <h2>Creatine</h2>
                <p>
                    another nutrient that can highly influence muscle growth is of course creatine creatine is an
                    organic molecule produced mainly in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidneys and the
                    pancreas this molecule enhances phosphocreatine storage in your muscles which increases the amount
                    of phosphate availability for atp recycling bottom line is that your muscles can produce more energy
                    that's why supplementing with creatine can enhance strength power and general workout performance as
                    i said creatine supplementation is also excellent for muscle growth for example we have a study that
                    found that men that trained for six weeks and also supplemented with creatine gained on average two
                    kilograms more muscle mass than men that received a placebo instead

                <h2>Omega 3</h2>
                <p>
                    next we have omega-3 fatty acids which are often overlooked for how important and beneficial they
                    can be most people do recognize that omega-3 fatty acids have a broad range of health benefitsnext
                    we have omega-3 fatty acids which are often overlooked for how important and beneficial they can be
                    most people do recognize that omega-3 fatty acids have a broad range of health benefits including
                    reducing inflammation enhancing cardiovascular health markers and reducing the risk of depression
                    but not that many people know that consuming omega-3 fatty acids also boost muscle growth that's
                    right increasing omega-3 intake enhances lean body mass and muscle growth that's actually a fact
                    backed up by many different studies there are many reasons for this including that omega-3s can
                    lower chronic inflammation levels protect against excessive muscle damage lower cortisol benefit
                    testosterone levels enhance nutrient partitioning and raise muscle anabolic signaling
